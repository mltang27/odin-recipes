<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made by layering sheets of pasta with rich meat or vegetable sauce, creamy béchamel or ricotta, and melted cheese, typically baked until golden and bubbly. Its hearty, flavorful layers make it a comforting and satisfying meal.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 pound sweet Italian sausage</li>
    <li>½ cup minced onion</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
    <li>1 can crushed tomatoes</li>
    <li>2 cans canned tomato sauce</li>
    <li>2 cans tomato paste</li>
    <li>1/2 cup water</li>
    <li>1 1/2 teaspoon of dried basil leaves</li>
    <li>1 1/2 teaspoons of salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon italian seasoning</li>
    <li>12 Lasagna noodles</li>
    <li>16 ounces of ricotta cheese</li>
    <li>3/4 cups of grated parmesan cheese</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cook Sausage, onion, and garlic over medium heat until browned</li>
    <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with basil leaves, italian seasoning, and salt. Stir occasionally.</li>
    <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add some salt. Cook the lasagna sheets in the boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain the noodles, and then rinse with cold water</li>
    <li>In a seperate mixing bowl, mix the ricotta cheese, parmesan cheese, add salt and some italian seasoning</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees fahrenheight.</li>
    <li>To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese. Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
    <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</li>
    <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
