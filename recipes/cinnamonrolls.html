<h3>Description</h3>
<p>TikTok cinnamon rolls using premade Pillsbury dough are a viral hack where you enhance the classic Pillsbury cinnamon rolls by adding heavy cream, butter, and extra cinnamon before baking, resulting in soft, gooey rolls with a rich, caramelized flavor. This easy, quick method transforms the store-bought dough into indulgent, bakery-style treats perfect for breakfast or dessert.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Refrigerated jumbo-sized cinnamon rolls</li>
    <li>Heavy cream</li>
    <li>Cream cheese</li>
    <li>Powdered sugar</li>
    <li>Vanilla extract</li>
    <li>Salted butter</li>
    <li>Brown sugar</li>
    <li>Ground cinnamon</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Unwrap cinnamon rolls. Peel the paper off the tube of whatever cinnamon roll dough you are working with and arrange them in a large 9×13-inch baking dish. You can also easily halve the recipe and use a smaller baking dish if you don’t want as many cinnamon rolls.</li>
    <li>Drizzle heavy cream. Go ahead and pour the heavy cream right over and around the cinnamon rolls. The goal is to cover the bottom of the pan and make sure there is a little cream between each of the rolls.</li>
    <li>Make brown sugar cinnamon topping. Melt butter in a medium bowl, then stir in the brown sugar and ground cinnamon to create a slurry. Spoon this over each of the cinnamon rolls.</li>
    <li>Cover and bake. Cover the pan with a large piece of aluminum foil, then bake at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 30 to 40 minutes. The timing can somewhat depend on the brand of cinnamon rolls, how tightly spaced they are in your pan, and your oven. They should be golden brown on top and cooked through but still very moist when done.</li>
    <li>Make frosting. Meanwhile, beat cream cheese with the icing that came with the can of cinnamon roll dough until smooth. Add powdered sugar and vanilla extract and beat again.</li>
    <li>Cool, then frost. Once the cinnamon rolls are done, remove the foil and let them cool for about 5 minutes before frosting. This prevents the frosting from being completely absorbed by the cinnamon rolls, but they are still warm enough for the frosting to sort of melt around and into them, which adds another layer of gooeyness that we love.</li>
    <li>Serve warm!</li>
