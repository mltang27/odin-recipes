<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Guacamole is a fresh, creamy dip made by mashing ripe avocados and mixing them with ingredients like lime juice, onions, cilantro, and diced tomatoes for a burst of flavor. It’s a versatile, healthy dish perfect for pairing with chips, tacos, or as a topping for various meals.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Fresh avocados</li>
    <li>Cumin</li>
    <li>Fresh chopped jalepeno</li>
    <li>Fresh chopped cilantro</li>
    <li>Fresh lime juice</li>
    <li>Kosher salt & black pepper</li>
    <li>Chopped Roma Tomatoes</li>
    <li>Chopped Onion</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>In a large bowl (or molcajete if you have one), crush chopped cilantro, garlic, and onion (and jalapeno, if using) using the back of a spoon, grinding it against the bowl a bit to release its juices and aroma.</li>
    <li>Add the avocados, lime juice, salt, and cumin and mash with a fork until the avocados are mostly broken down and only smaller chunks remain. If you prefer chunkier guacamole, just don’t mash it quite as much. If you prefer smoother guac, keep on going until it’s the consistency you desire.  Stir in the chopped tomato.</li>
    <li>Top with extra chopped cilantro and store covered in an airtight container in the refrigerator until ready to use.</li>
